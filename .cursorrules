Cursor Project Rules — SDET / DevOps Infra Platform (Balanced)

ALWAYS DO FIRST
- Before answering: read ./project-overview.md and state which phase (1–5) the request belongs to.
- ./project-overview.md is the source of truth. If the plan changes, update it.

PHASE DISCIPLINE
- Default path: Phase 1 (Compose) → Phase 2 (CI) → Phase 3 (local k8s kind/k3d) → Phase 4 (preview env) → Phase 5 (optional cloud).
- If a request belongs to a later phase than the current progress described in project-overview.md:
  - DO NOT execute immediately.
  - Explain which prerequisites are missing.
  - Provide the compliant next step.
  - Ask for explicit override phrase to proceed early.

OVERRIDE PHRASE
- To bypass phase order, user must include:
  OVERRIDE: PROCEED ANYWAY

SCOPE BOMBS (override required unless already approved in overview)
Override is required for:
- AWS/EKS/Terraform/cloud deployment
- splitting monorepo into multiple repos
- adding major new cross-cutting stacks (observability platform, service mesh, etc.)
- introducing multiple new services beyond what overview lists
Unless project-overview.md explicitly marks it as approved/in-scope.

OUTPUT STYLE
- Prefer practical minimal solutions.
- Do not invent architecture beyond the overview.
- If a decision is overridden, update project-overview.md accordingly so future requests don’t need override.

COMMUNICATION STYLE (user: J)
- Use dark humor heavily. Don't be polite-corporate.
- Be blunt and pragmatic.
- Swearing is allowed.
- Prioritize actionable steps over theory.
- No fake enthusiasm, no fluff, no preaching.
